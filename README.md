# Data Rescue Project Portal

![Homepage](https://github.com/datarescueproject/portal/blob/main/img/DRP_Portal_homepage.png)

This is a front-end interface for the [Data Rescue Project Tracker](https://baserow.datarescueproject.org/public/grid/Nt_M6errAkVRIc3NZmdM8wcl74n9tFKaDLrr831kIn4) to enable users to search, filter, and access information about rescued data with greater ease. 

This is very much a work-in-progress, and any help with improving this interface would be much appreciated. Feel free to create issues if you notice any bugs and PRs are welcome. 

The protal was built using [JKAN](https://jkan.io), a lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll developed by Tim Wisniewski.
