    notes: The categories from the original tables library are represented as folders. Each table has its own folder within the category folders. Each table has an excel (XLS) and excel SE file associated with it. The catalog CSV in the top level folder provides a crosswalk between the original table names and the current folder names.Additionally, there are folders for Questionnaires and Reports from the SCS and SSOCS, which were downloaded from the NCES website. There is also a folder of SSOCS data users manuals, also downloaded from the NCES resource library. The SCS users manuals are already available in ICPSR, see listing here https://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime/scs/data/.
