    notes: Each table has an associated excel file, which is in a folder in the dataset (one folder per table).In the root folder, there is a catalog csv that provides a crosswalk between the folder names and file names and the original table titles.In addition to the tables, this project contains (1) user manuals for ECLS-K and ECLS-K2011 from the NCES resource library, (2) questionnaires for ECLS-K and ECLS-K2011 downloaded from the study website and (3) other reports and documentation related to the two studies from the NCES resource library.
