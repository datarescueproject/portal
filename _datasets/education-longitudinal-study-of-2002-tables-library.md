    notes: Each table has an associated excel and excel SE file, which are grouped together in a folder in the dataset (one folder per table).In the root folder, there is a catalog csv that provides a crosswalk between the folder names and file names and the original table titles.In addition to the tables, this project contains (1) codebooks for ELS generated in NCES datalabs and found in the NCES resource library, (2) questionnaires for ELS downloaded from the study website and (3) documentation and user manuals related to ELS found in the NCES resource library.
