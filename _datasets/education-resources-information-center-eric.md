    notes: A functional search interface for all ERIC fulltext PDFs, linked to archived copies on the WayBack Machine. The interface uses a reduced version of the database, based on a full copy extracted via the ERIC API. The interface can be easily mirrored on any web server as it is client-side only. All PDFs were archived on the WayBack Machine.
