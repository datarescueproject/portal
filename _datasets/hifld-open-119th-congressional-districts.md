    notes: Congressional districts are the 444 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable.The 119th Congress is seated from January 2023 through December 2024. In Connecticut, Illinois, and New Hampshire, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the congressional districts to cover all of the state or state equivalent area. In these areas with no congressional districts defined, the code "ZZ" has been assigned, which is treated as a single congressional district for purposes of data presentation. The TIGER/Line data for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas. The boundaries of all other congressional districts reflect information provided to the Census Bureau by the states by August 31, 2022.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB24/tlgdb_2024_a_us_legislative.gdb.zip Layer Congressional_DistrictsMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_cd118.shp.iso.xml
