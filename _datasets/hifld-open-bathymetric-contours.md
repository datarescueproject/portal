    notes: These data show bathymetric contours (isobaths) that help characterize the general physiographic patterns of the seafloor. Contour intervals are every 10 m from zero to -100 m, every 25 m from -100 m to -500 m, and every 100 m from -500 m to full depth. The DEM utilized was the Global Multi-Resolution Topography Synthesis which is a multi-resolution gridded global Digital Elevation Model that includes cleaned processed ship-based multibeam sonar data at their full spatial resolution (approximately 100m in the deep sea)
