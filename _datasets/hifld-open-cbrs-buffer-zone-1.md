    notes: This Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) data set, produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), contains areas designated as undeveloped coastal barriers in accordance with the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA), 16 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., as amended. The boundaries used to create the polygons herein were compiled from the official John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System CBRS maps, which are accessible at the Service’s Headquarters office or https://www.fws.gov/program/coastal-barrier-resources-act/maps-and-data. These digital polygons are only representations of the CBRS boundaries shown on the official CBRS maps and are not to be considered authoritative. The Service is not responsible for any misuse or misinterpretation of this digital data set, including use of the data to determine eligibility for federal financial assistance such as federal flood insurance. As maps are revised, this data set will be updated with the new boundaries. CBRS boundaries viewed using the CBRS Mapper or the shapefile are subject to misrepresentations beyond the Service’s control, including misalignments of the boundaries with third party base layers and mis-projections of spatial data. The official CBRS map is the controlling document and should be consulted for all official determinations. Official determinations are recommended for all properties that are in close proximity (within 20 feet) of a CBRS boundary. For an official determination of whether or not an area or specific property is located within the CBRS, please follow the procedures found at https://www.fws.gov/service/coastal-barrier-resources-system-property-documentation. For any questions regarding the CBRS, please contact your local Service field office or email CBRA@fws.gov.
