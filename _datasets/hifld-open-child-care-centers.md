    notes: This feature class/shapefile contains locations of child day care centers for the 50 states of the USA, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. The dataset only includes center based child day care locations (including those located at schools and religious institutes) and does not include group, home, and family based child day cares. The SOURCEDATE is an indicator of when the source data was last acquired or was publicly available. All the data was acquired from respective states departments or their open source websites and only contains data provided by these sources. Information on the source of data for each state is available in the SOURCE field of the feature class/shapefile. The TYPE attribute is a common categorization of child day care centers for all states which categorizes every child day care into Center Based, School Based, Head Start, or Religious Facility solely based on the type of facility where the child day care center is geographically located. This update has 2608 fewer records than the previous version based on source data.
