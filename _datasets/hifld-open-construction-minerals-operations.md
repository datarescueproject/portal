    notes: This map layer includes construction minerals operations in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey. The mineral operations are plants and (or) mines surveyed by the MIT and considered currently active in 2003. Excluded are construction sand and gravel and crushed stone. This is a replacement for the June 2004 map layer. The data is legacy and not expected to be updated. It is being provided as the best available until Mineral Resources identifies an alternative data source.
