    notes: The dataset shows all the dialysis centers across the United States & US Territories provided by Rx Open. Rx Open helps patients find nearby open pharmacies and dialysis centers in areas impacted by disaster. Combining multiple data feeds from the pharmaceutical industry, Rx Open provides the precise location of open centers, closed centers, and those whose status is unknown. This critical information assists government officials in assessing an emergency's impact on public health in a disaster area.
