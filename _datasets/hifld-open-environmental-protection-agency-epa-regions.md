    notes: This SEGS web service contains EPA facilities, EPA facilities labels, small- and large-scale versions of EPA region boundaries, and EPA regions extended to the 200nm exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Small scale EPA boundaries render at scales of less than 5 million, large scale EPA boundaries draw at scales greater than or equal to 5 million. EPA facilities labels draw at scales greater than 2 million. This SEGS dataset was produced by EPA's Office of Environmental Information (OEI). This web service layer shows the boundaries of EPA regions based on 2011 TIGER/Line geometry. This layer is drawn at scales of 5,000,001 or less. This SEGS dataset was produced by EPA through the Office of Environmental Information (OEI).
