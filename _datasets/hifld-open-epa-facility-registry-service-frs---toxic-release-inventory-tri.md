    notes: The Facility Registry Service (FRS) provides quality facility data to support EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment by identifying and geospatially locating facilities, sites, or places subject to environmental regulations of environmental interest. Facility data is improved with geospatial processing of incoming data and data curation tools to provide an integrated, dataset to partners and the public through a variety of methods and products. For more detailed information about these facilities, use the FRS Query tool. This layer provides facility information for the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). TRI is EPA's publicly available database that contains more than 650 toxic chemicals that are being used by industry groups and federal facilities, manufactured, treated, transported, or released into the environment. For more information on TRI and TRI facilities, visit the TRI Search tool.
