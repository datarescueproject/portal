    notes: Shared Enterprise Geodata and Services (SEGS) provides an EPA-curated collection of recommended geodata assets that are nationally relevant and support the Agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment. By connecting EPA users with curated datasets and promoting service reuse, SEGS aims to enhance information access, reduce data-storage costs, and improve the consistency and quality of data at the US EPA. This web service contains EPA facilities, EPA facilities labels, small- and large-scale versions of EPA region boundaries, and EPA region boundaries extended to the 200nm Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Small scale EPA boundaries and boundaries extended to the EEZ render at scales of less than 5 million, large scale EPA boundaries draw at scales greater than or equal to 5 million. EPA facilities labels draw at scales greater than 2 million. Data used to create this web service are available as a separate download at the Secondary Linkage listed above. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name in the web service table of contents (available through the online link provided above) and viewing the layer description. This dataset was produced by EPA through the Office of Environmental Information.
