    notes: The Facility Registry Service (FRS) provides quality facility data to support EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment by identifying and geospatially locating facilities, sites, or places subject to environmental regulations of environmental interest. Facility data is improved with geospatial processing of incoming data and data curation tools to provide an integrated, dataset to partners and the public through a variety of methods and products. For more detailed information about these facilities, use the FRS Query tool. This layer provides location and facility information for treatment, storage, and disposal sites found in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo). RCRAInfo is the EPA's comprehensive information system which supports the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and the Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) for 1984. For more information, visit the basics of Hazardous Waste webpage.
