    notes: The Facility Registry Service (FRS) provides quality facility data to support EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment by identifying and geospatially locating facilities, sites, or places subject to environmental regulations of environmental interest. Facility data is improved with geospatial processing of incoming data and data curation tools to provide an integrated, dataset to partners and the public through a variety of methods and products. For more detailed information about these facilities, use the FRS Query tool. This layer provides location and attribute information for Facilities regulated under the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS). SEMS integrates multiple legacy systems (e.g. CERCLIS, ICTS, SDMS) into a comprehensive inventory of active and archived hazardous waste sites evaluated by the Superfund program. It contains sites that are either proposed to be, or are on, the National Priorities List (NPL) as well as sites that are in the screening and assessment phase for possible inclusion in the NPL.
