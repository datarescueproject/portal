    notes: The attribute data for this point dataset come from EIA's U.S. Fuel Ethanol Plant Production Capacity report, which is sourced from U.S. Energy Information Administration, Form EIA-819, Monthly Report of Biofuels, Fuels from Non-Biogenic Wastes, Fuel Oxygenates, Isooctane, and Isooctene. Fuel Ethanol production capacity is intended to measure estimated gallons of fuel alcohol that a plant is capable of producing over a period of one year (365 consecutive days) starting on the first day of each report month.Production capacity in million gallons per year (MMgal/year).The facility location data represent the approximate location based on research of publicly available information from sources such as Federal agencies, company websites, and satellite images on public websites.
