    notes: The Summary of Deposits data is presented as reported by the FDIC-insured institutions that have submitted the annual survey. Although every attempt has been made to ensure the reliability of the information contained herein, some inaccuracies may exist. For this reason, the FDIC neither assume responsibility for, nor certify to the accuracy of any of the reported data. Further, these data do not indicate approval or disapproval of any particular institution's performance and are not to be construed as a rating of any institution by federal regulators. Users are cautioned that any conclusions that they may draw from the Summary of Deposits data are their own and are not to be attributed to the federal regulators. In addition, a determination of competitiveness is only one of several assessment factors used by Federal agencies during the application review process. The branch office deposit information is obtained primarily through the annual surveys of deposits conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Note of caution Longitude and latitude geo-coding may not always be at roof-top precision.
