    notes: This data set includes ferrous metal mines in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the operations are those considered active in 2003 and surveyed by the MIT. This is a replacement for the November 1998 map layer. No energy minerals operations are included. No secondary (recycling, "downstream") operations are included. The data is legacy and not expected to be updated. It is being provided as the best available until Mineral Resources identifies an alternative data source.
