    notes: The National Census of Ferry Operators (NCFO) Terminals dataset was collected through December 31, 2020 and compiled on October 16, 2024 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Ferry Terminals dataset represents all ferry terminals from operators that provided responses to the 2020 National Census of Ferry Operators. Areas covered by the dataset include the 50 states as well as the territories of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Island, and American Samoa. The terminals represent departure and arrival locations for ferry segments in the NCFO. As part of the NCFO questionnaire, respondents were asked terminal name, city, and state. From this information, longitude and latitudes were obtained through open, online searches that include operator websites and map platforms such as Google Maps and Open Street Maps. As a result, termina sometimes do not represent the exact location where ferry vessels dock but may represent other locations such as the operator’s business location or alternative docking locations. However, whenever possible, the terminal locations represent departure and arrival points for that ferry segment. Each terminal contains information about its operation and ownership status, in addition to geographic location and transportation connections, whenever operators provided this information.
