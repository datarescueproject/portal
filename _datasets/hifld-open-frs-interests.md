    notes: This feature service consists of location and facility identification information from EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS) for all sites that are available in the FRS individual feature layers. Although we have taken all available measures to optimize performance, because this service contains the full universe of FRS regulated facilities, the total data volume may lead to slow performance for many applications. We strongly recommend choosing from one of the feature services below which comprise the FRS major program databases, including Assessment Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES)  brownfields sites Air Facility System (AFS)  stationary sources of air pollutionICIS-AIR (AIR)  stationary sources of air pollutionBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)  schools data on Indian landBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC) facilitiesClean Air Markets Division Business System (CAMDBS)  market-based air pollution control programsComprehensive Environmental Response, Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) hazardous waste sitesIntegrated Compliance Information System (ICIS)  integrated enforcement and compliance informationNational Compliance Database (NCDB)  Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) module of ICIS  NPDES surface water permitsRadiation Information Database (RADINFO)  radiation and radioactivity facilitiesRACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC)  best available air pollution technology requirementsResource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo)  tracks generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous wasteToxic Release Inventory (TRI)  certain industries that use, manufacture, treat, or transport more than 650 toxic chemicalsEmission Inventory System (EIS)  inventory of large stationary sources and voluntarily-reported smaller sources of air point pollution emittersCountermeasure (SPCC) and facility response plan (FRP) subject facilitiesElectronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (E-GGRT)  large greenhouse gas emittersEmissions and; Generation Resource Integrated Database (EGRID)  power plants The Facility Registry Service (FRS) identifies and geospatially locates facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. Using vigorous verification and data management procedures, FRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the FRS facilities that link to the programs listed above once the program data has been integrated into the FRS database. Additional information on FRS is available at the EPA website https://www.epa.gov/frs. EPA also publishes a download package that includes a file geodatabase, Esri ArcMap map document and an XML file of this metadata record and is refreshed on the same cycle as this service. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer are contained in the database.
