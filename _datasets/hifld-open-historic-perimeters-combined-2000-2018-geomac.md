    notes: The Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination Group, or GeoMAC, is an internet-based mapping tool originally designed for fire managers to access online maps of current fire locations and perimeters in the US. Perimeters are submitted to GeoMAC by field offices. The GeoMAC team attributes the perimeters using various sources, and then posts them on the GeoMAC website and to an HTTP site for downloading. This file contains all the latest fire perimeters that were processed by the GeoMAC team between 2000 and 2018. The projection is geographic and the datum is NAD83. Perimeter data is derived from data produced by GIS specialists working on each incident.
