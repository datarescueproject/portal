    notes: Natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes affect both coastal and inland areas. Long-term data from these events can be used to establish the past record of natural hazard event occurrences, which is important for planning, response, and mitigation of future events. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) plays a major role in post-event data collection. The data in this archive is gathered from scientific and scholarly sources, regional and worldwide catalogs, tide gauge reports, individual event reports, and unpublished works. For more information, please see https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards To view this dataset in an interactive mapping application, please see the Global Natural Hazards Data Viewer (NOAA GeoPlatform entry). This is a feature layer displaying historical tsunami observations (also known as tsunami runups) from the Global Historical Tsunami Database at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.
