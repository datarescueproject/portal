    notes: The Facility Registry Service (FRS) provides quality facility data to support EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment by identifying and geospatially locating facilities, sites, or places subject to environmental regulations of environmental interest. Facility data is improved with geospatial processing of incoming data and data curation tools to provide an integrated, dataset to partners and the public through a variety of methods and products. For more detailed information about these facilities, use the FRS Query tool. This layer provides location and facility information for wastewater treatment plants from the Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS). The data are presented with three different view options at the facility level 1.) display of Publicly Owned Treatment Works and Federal facilities, 2.) Display of all facilities, categorized as Major, Minor and Other/Nonclassified, and 3.) Display of facilities with Combined Sewer Outfalls. ICIS contains all Federal Administrative and Judicial enforcement actions and a subset of the Permit Compliance System (PCS), which supports the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). To learn more about ICIS click here or use the Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database.
