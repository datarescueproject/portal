    notes: The Intermodal Freight Facilities - Marine Roll-on/Roll-off dataset was compiled on July 01, 2019 and was updated on July 22, 2022 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). When available, primary sources for this dataset were the websites of the ports, as well as port operators. Every facility is associated with a port and assumed to be served by both marine and truck, and those facilities which support rail operations, the reporting code for the operating rail company is also identified. The dataset also includes at least one Navigation Unit ID (NAV_UNIT_ID) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Port Facilities dataset which is associated with the Ro/Ro terminal. This dataset is one of several layers in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Intermodal Freight Facility Database.
