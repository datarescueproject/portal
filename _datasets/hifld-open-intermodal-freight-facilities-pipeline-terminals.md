    notes: The Intermodal Freight Facilities - Pipeline Terminals dataset was compiled on February 02, 2021 and was updated on April 21, 2021 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). Pipeline terminals interface between pipeline mode and other transportation modes. They have the ability to receive or deliver freight commodities via pipeline and truck/rail/water. The data consists of location information, truck/rail/water mode connections, storage capacity, and a list of commodities handled at the terminal. Geographical coverage includes the United States and U.S. territories. This dataset is one of several layers in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Intermodal Freight Facility Database.
