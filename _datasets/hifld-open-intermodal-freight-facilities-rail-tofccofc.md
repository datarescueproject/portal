    notes: The Intermodal Freight Facilities - Rail TOFC/COFC dataset was compiled on December 10, 2018 and was updated on July 22, 2022 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). When available, the primary sources for this dataset were the websites of the railroads. Every facility is assumed to be served by both rail and truck, and those facilities which support port operations, the name of the port is also identified. The dataset also includes the services provided at each facility (TOFC only, COFC only, or both TOFC and COFC), and the Station Point Location Code (SPLC) associated with the rail facility. This dataset is one of several layers in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Intermodal Freight Facility Database.
