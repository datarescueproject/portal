    notes: The Intermodal Passenger Connectivity Database (IPCD) dataset was compiled on August 10, 2021 and was updated October 19, 2022 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The IPCD is a nationwide database of passenger transportation terminals, with data on the availability of connections among the various scheduled public transportation modes at each facility. The IPCD data covers the following types of passenger transportation terminals/stops 1. Scheduled airline service airports. 2. Intercity bus stations (includes stations served by regular scheduled intercity bus service such as Greyhound, Trailways, code sharing buses such as Amtrak Thruway feeder buses, supplemental buses that provide additional frequencies along rail routes, and airport bus services from locations that are outside of the airport metropolitan area). 3. Intercity and transit ferry terminals. 4. Light-rail transit stations. 5. Heavy-rail transit stations. 6. Passenger-rail stations on the national rail network served by intercity rail and/or commuter rail services. 7. Bike-share stations belonging to bike-share systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike). The data elements describe the location of the above types of terminals as well as the availability of intercity, commuter, and transit rail; scheduled air service; intercity and transit bus; intercity and transit ferry services; and bike-share availability. Transit bus service locations are not specifically included in the database. However, the status of transit bus as a connecting mode is included for each bike-share facility in the database.
