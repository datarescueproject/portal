    notes: The USACE IENCs coverage area consists of 7,260 miles across 21 rivers primarily located in the Central United States. IENCs apply to inland waterways that are maintained for navigation by USACE for shallow-draft vessels (e.g., maintained at a depth of 9-14 feet, dependent upon the waterway project authorization). Generally, IENCs are produced for those commercially navigable waterways which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not produce Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). However, Special Purpose IENCs may be produced in agreement with NOAA.Isolated Danger Buoy Point used to mark small, isolated dangers where navigable water will be found in all directions around the marked danger.
