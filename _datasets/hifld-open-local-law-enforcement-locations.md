    notes: The local law enforcement locations feature class/ shapefile contains point location and tabular information pertaining to a wide range of law enforcement entities in the United States. Law Enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA). Unlike the previous version of this dataset, published in 2009, federal level law enforcement agencies are excluded from this effort. Data fusion techniques are utilized to synchronize overlapping yet disparate source data. The primary sources for this effort are the DOJ-BJS CSLLEA from 2008 and the previously mentioned 2009 feature class from Homeland Security Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). This feature class contains data for agencies across all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.
