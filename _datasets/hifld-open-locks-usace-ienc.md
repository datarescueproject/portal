    notes: The Navigation Data Center (NDC) produces and stores data on lock characteristics nationwide in the Lock Performance Monitoring System (LPMS) and the Lock Characteristics database. These data sets are developed using input from surveys conducted by NDC staff. Information collected includes the physical aspects of all USACE built, maintained, owned, or operated locks. The data set captures six major characteristics including location, physical characteristics, site information, site characteristics, management information, and historical changes.
