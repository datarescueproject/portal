    notes: This data set includes miscellaneous industrial minerals operations in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey. The mineral operations are plants and (or) mines surveyed by the MIT and considered currently active in 2003. This is a replacement for the July 2004 map layer. The data is legacy and not expected to be updated. It is being provided as the best available until Mineral Resources identifies an alternative data source.This data set is intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 12,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
