    notes: The Mobile Home Parks feature class/shapefile contains locations that represent mobile home, residential trailer, and recreational vehicle (RV) parks within the Continental United States and Alaska. The people residing in these housing types are the most vulnerable residential population to hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 31% of the people that perished in tornadoes between 2009 and 2011 were residing in or fleeing from mobile homes. An inventory of mobile home park locations and the number of mobile homes within those parks is, therefore, essential for emergency preparedness, response, and evacuation. In the latest update 2281 records were added.
