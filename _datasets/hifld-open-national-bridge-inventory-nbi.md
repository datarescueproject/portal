    notes: The National Bridge Inventory dataset is as of June 27, 2024 from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The data describes more than 615,000 of the Nation's bridges located on public roads, including Interstate Highways, U.S. highways, State and county roads, as well as publicly-accessible bridges on Federal and Tribal lands. The inventory data present a complete picture of the location, description, classification, and general condition data for each bridge. The element data present a breakdown of the condition of each structural and bridge management element for each bridge on the National Highway System (NHS). The Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges contains a detailed description of each data element including coding instructions and attribute definitions. The Coding Guide is available at https://doi.org/10.21949/1519105.
