This layer's attribution contains physical, demographic, and capacity information for facilities in the continental United States and some of its territories. The purpose of this layer is to provide accurate locations for a potential shelter in the event of a disaster. The facilities included have been designated as a Shelter by either the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the American Red Cross (ARC). THIS LAYER SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DETERMINE THE OPERATIONAL STATUS OF A FACILITY DURING AN ACTIVE EMERGENCY
