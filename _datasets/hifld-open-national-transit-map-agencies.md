    notes: The National Transit Map - Agencies dataset was compiled on September 09, 2024 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The National Transit Map (NTM) is a nationwide catalog of fixed-guideway and fixed-route transit service in America. It is compiled using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Schedule data. The NTM Agencies dataset represents the physical addresses of participating transit agencies. Regarding data coverage and licenses, starting in Report Year 2023, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has required National Transit Database (NTD) Reporters to submit General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. Reporters will submit GTFS during their reporting period, which is determined by their fiscal year end date. All GTFS data submitted to the NTD will enter the public domain. Prior to the GTFS requirement, transit agencies voluntarily participated in the NTM and granted the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States (CC-BY-3.0) license.
