    notes: The National Transit Map - Routes dataset was compiled on September 09, 2024 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The National Transit Map (NTM) is a nationwide catalog of fixed-guideway and fixed-route transit service in America. It is compiled using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Schedule data. The NTM Routes dataset shows transit routes, which is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service. To display the route alignment and trips for each route, this dataset combines the following GTFS files routes.txt, trips.txt, and shapes.txt. To improve the spatial accuracy of the NTM Routes, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) adjusts transit routes using context from the submitted GTFS source data and/or from other publicly available information about the transit service.
