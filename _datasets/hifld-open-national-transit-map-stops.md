    notes: The National Transit Map - Stops dataset was compiled on September 09, 2024 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The National Transit Map (NTM) is a nationwide catalog of fixed-guideway and fixed-route transit service in America. It is compiled using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Schedule data. The NTM Stops dataset shows stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders. This dataset uses the GTFS stops.txt file. The GTFS schedule format and structure documentation is available at, https://gtfs.org/schedule/. To improve the spatial accuracy of the NTM Stops, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) adjusts transit stops using context from the submitted GTFS source data and/or from other publicly available information about the transit service.
