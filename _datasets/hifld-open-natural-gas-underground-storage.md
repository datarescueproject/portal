    notes: The attribute data for this point dataset come from EIA’s U.S. field level storage data, which is sourced from U.S. Energy Information Administration, Form EIA-191, Monthly Underground Gas Storage Report. It includes both active and inactive natural gas storage fields. EIA-191 collects information on working and base gas in reservoirs, injections, withdrawals, and location of reservoirs from operators of all underground natural gas storage fields on a monthly basisThe facility location data represent the approximate location based on research of publicly available information from sources such as Federal agencies, company websites, and satellite images on public websites.
