    notes: The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) that insures the savings of 80 million account holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions.
