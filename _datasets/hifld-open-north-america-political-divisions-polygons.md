    notes: The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data. A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their relative positions are correct. This collection of data sets forms a base with which other North American thematic data may be integrated. Any data outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of the data.The new version of the North American Atlas - Political Boundaries data set shows political entities in North America as polygons representing jurisdictional areas, such as, International boundaries, Provincial boundaries and State or territory boundaries.This is a revised version of the 2010 data set released by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation. This new version integrates political boundaries spatial vector information published by each country in 2021. The data set includes 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada; 32 states in Mexico; 48 states and the District of Columbia in the conterminous United Sates, Alaska and Hawaii, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean region.Files Download
