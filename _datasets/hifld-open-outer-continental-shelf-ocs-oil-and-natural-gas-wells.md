    notes: This Regional Map Service contains information from both the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) within the Department of Interior (DOI) for the purpose of managing offshore federal real estate leases for oil, gas and renewable energy. These data layers are being made available as REST mapping services for the purpose of web viewing and map overlay viewing in GIS systems. Due to re-projection issues which occur when converting multiple UTM zone data to a single national or regional projected space, and line type changes that occur when converting from UTM to geographic projections, these data layers should not be used for official or legal purposes. Only the original data found within BOEM/BSEE’s official internal database, federal register notices or official paper or pdf map products may be considered as the official information or mapping products used by BOEM or BSEE. These and other cadastre information the BOEM and BSEE produces are generated in accordance with 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and mineral resource management. For more information - Contact Division Chief, Geospatial Services Division, BOEM, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166 Telephone (703) 787-1312; Email mappingboundarybranch@boem.gov
