    notes: These data contain a national scale spatial footprint of the outer boundaries of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM’s) Official Protraction Diagrams (OPDs). These polygons are clipped to the Submerged Land Act Boundary and Continental Shelf Boundaries and are updated as needed. OPDs are mapping products produced and used by the BOEM to delineate areas available for potential offshore mineral leases, determine the State/Federal offshore boundaries, and determine the limits of revenue sharing and other boundaries to be considered when leasing offshore waters. The OPDs serve as the legal definition for BOEM offshore boundary coordinates and area descriptions. These data show only the outline of the maps that are available from BOEM. Only the most recently published paper or pdf versions of the OPDs should be used for official or legal purposes. Further information on the history of the development of OPDs can be found in OCS Report MMS 99-0006 Boundary Development on the Outer Continental Shelf.These data were created in the applicable NAD83 UTM or NAD27 UTM/SPCS Projection and re-projected to GCS WGS84 (EPSG 4326) for management in BOEM's enterprise GIS. However, this service in this collection has been published in WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (EPSG 3857). Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these data are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact boundaries. These data are to be used for Cartographic purposes only and should not be used to calculate area.
