    notes: The attribute data for this point dataset come from U.S. Energy Information Administration, Form EIA-815, Monthly Bulk Terminal and Blender Report. A bulk terminal is a facility primarily used for storage, marketing, and, in many cases, blending of petroleum products, unfinished oils, biofuels, and natural gas liquids. The geographic area the report covers is the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and other U.S. possessions. The facility location data represent the approximate location based on research of publicly available information from sources such as Federal agencies, company websites, and satellite images on public websites.
