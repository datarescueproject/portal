    notes: This feature class/shapefile represents Petroleum Terminals. Petroleum Terminals are used to provide storage of both crude oil and refined petroleum products. Data contains locational and other attribute information for operable bulk petroleum product terminals with a total bulk shell storage capacity of 50,000 barrels or more, and/or ability to receive volumes from tanker, barge, or pipeline. Geographical coverage includes the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and Northern Marina Islands. This update includes revalidation of 658 records, the addition of 10 new records and the removal of 47 records for a total of 2,302 terminals. 8 terminals were removed because it was confirmed that they no longer exist. 22 terminals were removed because they were confirmed as duplicate records. 17 terminals were merged with adjacent terminals. Domains for the TYPE and COMMODITY fields were standardized in the layer and added to the metadata.
