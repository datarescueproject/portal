    notes: The prison boundary feature class contains secure detention facilities. These facilities range in jurisdiction from federal(excluding military) to local governments. Polygon geometry is used to describe the extent of where the incarcerated population is located (fence lines or building footprints). This feature class's attribution describes many physical and social characteristics of detention facilities in the United States and some of its territories. The attribution for this feature class was populated by open source search methodologies of authoritative sources. Changes from the previous version include 80 records added, 132 closed, 30 reopened, and 363 removed.
