    notes: GCCA Warehouse is the third-party temperature-controlled warehousing industry’s association. Founded in 1891 as the American Warehousemen’s Association in 1891; to National Association of Refrigerated Warehouses independently in 1961; to International Association of Warehouses in 1972; and to Global Cold Chain Alliance in 2023 to present. The Association as we know it today, was originally established when conventional warehousemen took on the demands of storing perishable food and soon realized the increased challenge and complexity of operating temperature-controlled storage facilitiesToday, the GCCA Warehouse sector promotes best practices in the temperature-controlled warehousing and logistics industry through research, industry benchmarking, networking, and education. GCCA Warehouse also advocates for members in legislative and regulatory arenas. All active members of GCCA are also members and beneficiaries of the work of the Global Cold Chain Foundation.
