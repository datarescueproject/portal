    notes: The Railroad Bridges dataset was compiled on October 14, 2022 from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). A railroad bridge is defined as “Railroad bridge means any structure with a deck, regardless of length, which supports one or more railroad tracks, or any other undergrade structure with an individual span length of 10 feet or more located at such a depth that it is affected by live loads.” based on the Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR Part 237). The FRA does not have a mandate to inspect railroad bridges these inspections are required by the owner of the track. The FRA will use this railroad bridge dataset to determine the number of bridges per railroad, state, etc. and will assist in determining priority field activities.
