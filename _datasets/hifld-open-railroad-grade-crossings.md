    notes: The Railroad Grade Crossings dataset was updated on July 07, 2024 and was created on October 13, 2024 by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Railroad Grade Crossings is a spatial file that originates from the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory Program. The program is to provide information to the public, Federal, State, and Local governments, as well as the railroad industry for information and the improvements of safety at highway-rail crossings. Some railroad grade crossings were located outside the US or their respective states, and relocated to latitude longitude 0,0.
