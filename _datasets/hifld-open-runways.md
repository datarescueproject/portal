    notes: Current Effective Date 0901Z 16 May 2024 to 0901Z 11 Jul 2024. A runway is a defined rectangular area on a land airport prepared for the landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. Runways are normally numbered in relation to their magnetic direction rounded off to the nearest 10 degrees. This geospatial vector file provides information on the airport runway and helicopter landing areas. Runway information is published every eight weeks by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration-Aeronautical Information Services.
