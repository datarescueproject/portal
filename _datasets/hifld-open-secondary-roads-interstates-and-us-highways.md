    notes: Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway, State Highway, or County Highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways. They often have both a local name and a route number.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB24/tlgdb_2024_a_us_roads.gdb.zipMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_roads.shp.iso.xml
