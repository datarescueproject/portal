    notes: School Districts are administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districtsThe Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts.The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB24/tlgdb_2024_a_us_school.gdb.zip Layer School_District_SecondaryMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_scsd.shp.iso.xml
