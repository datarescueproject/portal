    notes: Various shipping zones delineate activities and regulations for marine vessel traffic. Traffic lanes define specific traffic flow, while traffic separation zones assist opposing streams of marine traffic. Precautionary areas represent areas where ships must navigate with caution, and shipping safety fairways designate where artificial structures are prohibited. Recommended Routes are predetermined routes for shipping adopted for reasons of safety. Along certain zones of the East Coast of the United States, ships are required to reduce speeds to 10 knots or less over ground during seasonal periods within designated endangered species areas, such as the North Atlantic Right Whales. Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas need special protection because of their vulnerability to damage by international maritime activities. Areas to be avoided are within defined limits where navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships.
