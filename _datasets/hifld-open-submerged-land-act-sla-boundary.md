    notes: These data contain a national scale Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary line, Limit of "8(g) Zone," line and Continental Shelf Boundary. The SLA boundary defines the seaward limit of a state's submerged lands and the landward boundary of federally managed OCS lands. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act "8(g) Zone" lies between the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary line and a line projected 3 nautical miles seaward of the SLA boundary line. Within this zone, oil and gas revenues are shared with the coastal state(s). The Continental Shelf Boundary defines the seaward limit of federally managed OCS lands. The line depicts the limit of U.S. jurisdiction for offshore mineral development.These data were created in the applicable NAD83 UTM or NAD27 UTM/SPCS Projection and re-projected to GCS WGS84 (EPSG 4326) for management in BOEM's enterprise GIS. However, this service in this collection has been published in WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (EPSG 3857). Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these data are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact boundaries. These data are to be used for Cartographic purposes only and should not be used to calculate area.
