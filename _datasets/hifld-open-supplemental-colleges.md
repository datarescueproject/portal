    notes: The Supplemental Colleges feature class/shapefile contains additional postsecondary education features that are not included in the National Center for Education (NCES) Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS). Included are Doctoral/Research Universities, Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associates Colleges, Theological seminaries, Medical Schools and other health care professions, Schools of engineering and technology, business and management, art, music, design, Law schools, Teachers colleges, Tribal colleges, and other specialized institutions. Any results or conclusions based on the POPULATION, TOT_ENROLL, and TOT_EMP values contained in this layer should be verified. This feature class contains all MEDS/MEDS+ as approved by NGA. Complete feature class information is available in the “Entities and Attributes” metadata section for these and other field details. Geographical coverage is detailed in the Place Keyword section of the metadata and the thumbnail graphic above. This feature class does not have a relationship class but is related to Colleges and Universities by the IPEDS ID. This release includes 48 new records and updates to the TYPE and STATUS fields based on the current release of IPEDS on 2747 records. Thirteen (13) were removed as their parent records are no longer in the IPEDS data or IPEDS now accounts for that institution.
