    notes: The Travel Monitoring Analysis System (TMAS) - Stations dataset was compiled on December 31, 2023 and was published on July 22, 2024 from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). Geospatial station data from the FHWA TMAS database contains latitude and longitude data from over 7,000 permanent (temporal data representing each time period) traffic monitoring sites in all 50 states plus DC. Data from these stations are submitted to FHWA every month and is a result of a long standing partnership between FHWA and the state DOTs.
