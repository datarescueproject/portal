    notes: Truck Driving Schools in the United States This dataset is composed of any type of Post Secondary Education facility such as colleges, universities, technical schools, or trade schools that provide training and certification in the field of professional truck driving. This dataset does not include Administration Only locations. No entities located in American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands are included in this dataset. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 12/19/2006 and the newest record dates from 1/8/2007.
