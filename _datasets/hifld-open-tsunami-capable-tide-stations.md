Coastal tide gauge data also undergo quality control and harmonic analysis at NCEI. The raw data and products are discoverable via the Map, Timelines, and THREDDS Data Server links. Data are provided as netCDF and as gzipped comma-separated-values (CSV).Map legendPlease contact haz.info@noaa.gov if you have questions.More information about tsunami-capable tide gauge data at NCEI
