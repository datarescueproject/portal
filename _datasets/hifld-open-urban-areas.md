    notes: After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the urban footprint. There are 2,644 Urban Areas (UAs) in this data release with either a minimum population of 5,000 or a housing unit count of 2,000 units. Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeros. For 2020 Census products and beyond, the Census Bureau eliminated the distinction between Urbanized Areas and Urban Clusters. All urban areas are now identified by the generic term, “Urban Area.”Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB24/tlgdb_2024_a_us_nationgeo.gdb.zip Layer Urban_Area_20Metadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_uac20.shp.iso.xml
