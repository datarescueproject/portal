    notes: The international boundary data featured in this shapefile consists of the boundary between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico. Each country's section is administered independently. The United States and Canada border data was provided by the International Boundary Commission, United States and Canada (IBC). The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) provided the United States and Mexico section of the border data. Geospatial data files provided individually by the IBC and IBWC were used to re-align the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER System data for the agency's representation of the international boundaries of United States with Canada and Mexico. The Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER System and the IBWC source file data for the portion of the United States and Mexico border featured a gap between Cameron County, Texas and the three-mile limit in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coast Survey Office's representation of the United States and Mexico boundary used to fill this gap.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/INTERNATIONALBOUNDARY/tl_2023_us_internationalboundary.zipMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/tl_2023_us_internationalboundary.shp.iso.xml
