    notes: Estates are subdivisions of the three major islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. They primarily represent areas of the former agricultural plantations that existed at the time Denmark transferred the islands to the United States in 1917. The names and boundaries of the estates are in common usage by residents and in government administration. Estates were first recognized as a geographic area for the 2010 Census and are considered their own type of geographic entity separate in the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. There are 335 estates.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/ESTATE/tl_2023_78_estate.zipMetadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2023_estate.shp.iso.xml
