    notes: This dataset represents all Streamgage Monitoring Stations from the U.S. Geological Survey, for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in 2025. Gaging stations, or gages, measure the height (stage) and volume of flow at a point location on a water feature. Gages in this map layer were drawn from the National Water Information System (NWIS) Web Interface and linked to the National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2) flowline feature class. Each Streamgage point contains a link to the USGS Water Data site, which provides daily statistics reported from the station.Data pulled from GeoJSON Release Rebuild with latest NWIS · internetofwater/ref_gages · GitHubThe GeoJSON file references NHDPlusV2 identifiers and the “reference mainstems” which are governed herehttps://github.com/internetofwater/ref_rivers/
