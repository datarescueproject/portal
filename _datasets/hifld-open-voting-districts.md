    notes: Voting Districts (VTDs) refer to the generic name for geographic entities such as precincts, wards, and election districts established by state governments for the purpose of conducting elections. States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. Each VTD is identified by a one-to six-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. The code "ZZZZZZ" identifies a portion of counties (usually bodies of water) for which no VTDs were identified. For 2010 Census, only Kentucky and Rhode Island did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist in these states for 2010 Census data products. In two other states - Montana and Oregon - not all counties have voting districts defined. Participating states often submitted VTDs conforming to the feature network in the MAF/TIGER database rather than the complete legal boundary of the VTD. If requested by the participating state, the Census Bureau identified the VTDs that represent an actual voting district with an "A" in the voting district indicator field. Where a participating state indicated that the VTD has been modified to follow existing features, the VTD is a pseudo-VTD, and the voting district indicator contains "P." Where a participating state did not indicate to the Census Bureau whether the VTD followed the actual boundaries of the VTD or is a pseudo-VTD, the field is blank. VTD delineation was not offered to the Island Areas.Download https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020PL/LAYER/VTD/2020/Metadata https://meta.geo.census.gov/data/existing/decennial/GEO/GPMB/TIGERline/Current_19115/series_tl_2020_vtd20.shp.iso.xml
