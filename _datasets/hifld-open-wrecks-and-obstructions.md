    notes: Shipwrecks and obstructions in the ocean have long been a hazard to navigation and construction, and points of interest to archaeologists, recreational divers, fishermen, educators, and explorers. Locating hazardous wrecks and obstructions is part of the ongoing NOAA charting process. The exact position of many wrecks is difficult to determine because of changes in the environment, varied survey methods, and human error. Some wrecks are intentionally placed in the ocean to serve as artificial reefs or for disposal. Others pose a health and environmental threat from their cargo. Ownership and control over wrecks and obstructions is governed by a collection of state and federal regulations, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and National Marine Sanctuaries Act.These data are a synthesis of two sources—the NOAA Office of Coast Survey’s 2016 Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS), and NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC). Not included were those records that were clearly identified as natural features such as rocks, shoals, and trees. Features are recorded as either a wreck, wreck area, obstruction, or unknown.Direct data download | MetadataThis item is curated by the MarineCadastre.gov team.
