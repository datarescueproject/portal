    notes: Each table has an associated excel file, which is in a folder in the dataset (one folder per table).In the root folder, there is a catalog csv that provides a crosswalk between the folder names and file names and the original table titles.In addition to the tables, this project contains (1) codebooks for HS&B generated in NCES datalabs and found on the study website, (2) questionnaires for HS&B downloaded from the study website and (3) documentation related to HS&B found in the NCES resource library.
