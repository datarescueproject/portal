    notes: NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program conducts crash tests to determine how well a vehicle protects its occupants during a crash, and rollover resistance tests to determine the risk of a vehicle rolling over in a single-vehicle crash. Also, NCAP conducts advanced driver assistance system tests to determine how well the system avoids a crash. CrashworthinessTest data obtained from the crashworthiness and rollover tests are used to generate safety ratings for each vehicle, which are included on a label required to be placed on each new vehicle at the point of sale. A rating of five stars indicates the highest safety rating, whereas a one star indicates the lowest rating.Crash AvoidanceData collected from the program’s crash avoidance tests are used to provide safety technology recommendations based on system performance. The star ratings information and safety technology recommendations provide consumers with important vehicle safety information to help them make informed purchasing decisions. All tests are conducted under controlled conditions at laboratories contracted by NHTSA.
