These documents include the 1) short form disclosure; 2) the long form disclosure, which includes fee information and statements required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure; and 3) the prepaid agreement.For the first two itemsThe short form disclosure sets forth a short summary of key fees (for example, the monthly fee, if there is one) and other information about the prepaid account (such as whether overdraft/credit is offered). It must be in a specific format.The long form disclosure is the companion to the short form disclosure and provides more comprehensive fee information, including all fees that may be imposed in connection with the prepaid account, and the conditions under which they may be imposed.
