    notes: This page collects all of the tables in the PSS tables library. The tables are organized into folders by year, and then further folders by category. Finally, each table has its own folder, which contains one or two excel files depending on the table.Every year folder has a catalog csv that provides a crosswalk between the folder names and the original table names, except for the 2001-2002 folder, where a catalog could not be generated.Additionally, the documentation folder has all documentation and methodological documents found here https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/pssdata.asp, though not data files.The reports folder contains reports related to PSS found via searching NCES's resource library.
