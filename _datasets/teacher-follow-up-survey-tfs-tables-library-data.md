    notes: Each table has an associated excel and excel SE file, which are grouped together in a folder in the dataset (one folder per table). The folders are named based on the excel file names, as they were when downloaded from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) website.In the TFS folder, there is a catalog csv that provides a crosswalk between the folder names and the table titles.The documentation folder contains (1) codebooks for TFS generated in NCES datalabs, (2) questionnaires for TFS downloaded from the study website and (3) reports related to TFS found in the NCES resource library
