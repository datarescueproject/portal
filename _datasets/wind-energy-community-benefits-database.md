notes: "–At the Sabin Center, we link to this site from our community benefits database. Other groups have indicated that they use the database to pull example agreements that communities can use in determining what to ask developers for. –For webpage archiving- OEDP's contact let us know there are a lot of really helpful guides and maps on the windexchange website that they're worried will get taken down."
